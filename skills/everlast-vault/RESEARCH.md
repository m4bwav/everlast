# Research: everlast-vault

Findings that back [SKILL.md](SKILL.md). Changes they caused are logged in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md); procedural lessons live in [LEARNINGS.md](LEARNINGS.md); test runs and their evidence in [TESTS.md](TESTS.md); schedule and state in `evergreen.json`. Protocol: MAINTENANCE.md.

Topic: cross-tool installation of agent skills and plugins, private git-backed knowledge stores, redaction and encryption at rest for agent notes. Tier `fast`. Last refresh 2026-09-13; next due 2026-09-27.

## Current understanding

<The 5 to 40 lines a reader needs to trust the main file: what is settled, what is contested, what is moving. Edit sentences in place on refresh; never regenerate the section.>

## Open questions

- <Things the last refresh could not settle. Resolve or carry forward each refresh.>

## Search plan

Four tracks; every refresh runs at least one query on each (scope each to the period since the last refresh; add the year). Protocol §4 explains the tracks and how tooling, practice and testing findings are judged.

Subject (the goal and the latest thinking on reaching it):

- `<query 1>`
- `<query 2>`

Tooling (skills, plugins, MCP servers, scripts, knowledge graphs built for this subject):

- `path:SKILL.md "<topic>"` on GitHub code search, sorted by recently updated; `npx skills find "<topic>"` and skills.sh for install counts
- `https://registry.modelcontextprotocol.io/v0/servers?search=<topic>`; fallback `"<topic>" mcp server site:glama.ai OR site:pulsemcp.com`
- `"<topic>" skill OR plugin OR "mcp server" <year> site:github.com`

Practice (how others use AI agents on this goal, and everything in between):

- `"how I use" OR "my workflow" "<topic>" "claude code" OR codex OR cursor <year>`
- `site:arxiv.org "<topic>" agent "case study" OR empirical OR telemetry <year>`
- `"<topic>" site:simonwillison.net OR site:latent.space OR site:anthropic.com/engineering <year>`; hn.algolia.com `"<topic>" agent` sorted by date

Testing (how work on this subject is verified, and how skills for it are tuned):

- `"<topic>" verify OR validate OR "smoke test" OR checker agent <year>` (what evidence shows the job was done)
- `path:SKILL.md "<topic>" test OR eval OR evals` on GitHub; `"<topic>" evals OR "eval suite" OR regression "agent skill" <year>`
- `site:arxiv.org "<topic>" agent evaluation OR benchmark <year>`; promptfoo, Inspect or DeepEval docs for assertion types that fit this subject

Best sources (primary first): <official docs / changelog / standards body / key papers; for tooling: skills.sh, the MCP registry, the anthropics plugin catalogs; for testing: the subject's own test tools and the eval-framework docs>. Sources that proved noisy: <list, so they are skipped next time; SEO "top 10" listicles and scraped mega-directories are noise by default>.

## Findings log

Newest first. One entry per material finding; a quiet refresh gets one entry saying so. `Track` is subject, tooling, practice, or testing.
